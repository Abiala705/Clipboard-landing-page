### Links

- Live Site URL: [Abiala-Clipboard](https://abiala-clipboard.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I built this 2nd landing page using HTML and CSS. It took awhile before I was able to get the layout for the mobile screen. I had to go through each sections one after the other and walk my way down. I used various materials in W3schools to be able to hover all the interactive elements. I encountered serious issue manipulating the svgs like the facebook (turning blue when a mouse hover over it).

### Continued development

I got stuck while trying to give class names to semantic elements. I saw a resource online on BEM methodology. I will check and use it to refine my knowledge in the next project.
